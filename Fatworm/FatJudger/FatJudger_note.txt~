How to test single dataPoint:
For Linux:
java -cp Fatworm-htx.jar:bin/ org.acmclass.fatworm.test.TestTool -ts $1 -tm fat
Then in the shell, Do something like this:./test.sh basic1
For Windows:
Similiar to Linux, change the -ts 15 to %1, then you can run.bat basic1
I didn't test windows, if something's wrong, please tell me
