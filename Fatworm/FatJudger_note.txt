How to test single dataPoint:
For Linux:
java -cp Fatworm-htx.jar:bin/ org.acmclass.fatworm.test.TestTool -ts $1 -tm fat
Then in the shell, Do something like this:./test.sh basic1
For Windows:
Similiar to Linux, change the -ts 15 to %1, then you can run.bat basic1
I didn't test windows, if something's wrong, please tell me

I run 'sort', Sister gives 5min and Judger gives 20min
I checked Judger's source, and found:
if(statement.getResultSet()==null || statement.getResultSet().getMetaData()==null ||statement.getResultSet().getMetaData().getColumnCount()==0){
                            isQuery=false;
                        }
That's to say, statement.getResultSet() is executed three times meaninglessly...
Well, if the query is gorup or order, in getResultSet() I will do everything, so this is really &*&#@*#@
If you meet the same problem, open the scan when the resultSet does next() ^_^
