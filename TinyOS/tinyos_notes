For installing I added a few lines in the .docx which TA gave us. There's no serious problem.

I wrote makeTiny.sh for Burning Images with ID.
The runJava.sh along with Message.java and Displayer.java for data displaying.

If you make use with these tools well, in your development all you must do is just ./makeTiny.sh ID and ./runJava.sh(with the sink node) in the terminal and everything is done.

SO YOU SHOULD spend several minutes reading through my *.sh and *.java to understand what they are doing, it's rather easy. Ask me if there's confusion.
Attention 1: I give up the mig java tool(So in my Makefile I commented out these) because I don't know how to use mig. So if you changed your packet format, you also must change the Message.java, then runjava.sh will take care of compiling and displaying.
Attention 2: The $1 in runJava.sh is not for ID.
