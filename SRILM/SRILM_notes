I follow the install steps on the web
==============================install===============================
In make, I find I can't find the installed iconv-lib, so I need to set the environment variable(found in the INSTALL manual, Kai pointed to us that it's a environment variable)
	NO_ICONV=1
When I install iconv, I installed it to /usr/local/libï¼Œto run programs in SRILM/bin/i686-m64, I need to make links to /usr/lib
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libiconv.so.2 /usr/lib/libiconv.so.2
Add bin folder to $PATH
Add this line to the end of .bashrc
	export PATH=$PATH:/home/slhome/txh18/software/SRILM/bin/i686-m64
==============================Kai's scripts============================
It's put at
	scp -P 219 202.120.38.148:/slfs2/users/ky219/asr/wrdseg/lms/v0/README .

===ngram-count===
Most Important options:
	-order n
Set the maximal order (length) of N-grams to count. This also determines the order of the estimated LM, if any. The default order is 3.
	-vocab file
Read a vocabulary from file. Subsequently, out-of-vocabulary words in both counts or text are replaced with the unknown-word token. If this option is not specified all words found are implicitly added to the vocabulary.
	-write-vocab file
Write the vocabulary built in the counting process to file.
	-text textfile
Generate N-gram counts from text file. textfile should contain one sentence unit per line. Begin/end sentence tokens are added if not already present. Empty lines are ignored.
	-write file
Write total counts to file.
	-sort
Output counts in lexicographic order, as required for ngram-merge(1).
EXAMPLE:
	ngram-count -text test_htx.dat -write1 htx_1_gram
I get:
<s>	3
Hello	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Hetianxing	1
</s>	3
I	2
love	2
you	2
not	1
only	1

ngram-count -text test_htx.dat -write2 htx_2_gram
I get:
<s> Hello	1
<s> I	2
Hello my	1
my name	1
name is	1
is Hetianxing	1
Hetianxing </s>	1
I love	2
love you	1
love not	1
you </s>	2
not only	1
only you	1
