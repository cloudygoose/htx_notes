--caution: I didn't use -interpolate
--remember,  Z1 is the set of all words z with c(a_z) > 0:
--here's the process in the manual:
	f(a_z) = (c(a_z) - D0) / c(a_) 	;; for highest order N-grams
	f(_z)  = (n(*_z) - D1) / n(*_*)	;; for lower order N-grams
where the n(*_z) notation represents the number of unique N-grams that match a given pattern with (*) used as a wildcard for a single word. D0 and D1 represent two different discounting constants, as each N-gram order uses a different discounting constant. The resulting conditional probability and the backoff weight is calculated as given in equations (2) and (3):
	p(a_z)  = (c(a_z) > 0) ? f(a_z) : bow(a_) p(_z)     ; Eqn.2
	bow(a_) = (1 - Sum_Z1 f(a_z)) / (1 - Sum_Z1 f(_z))  ; Eqn.3

Warning 2
When -kndiscount or -ukndiscount options are used, the count file contains modified counts. Specifically, all N-grams of the maximum order, and all N-grams that start with <s> have their regular counts c(a_z), but shorter N-grams that do not start with <s> have the number of unique words preceding them n(*a_z) instead. See the description of -kndiscount and -ukndiscount for details.

Let's do some trying:
for d3 in 1-gram:
g(_z) = max(0, n(*_z) - D) / n(*_*)
g(_z) = (2 - 1.4) / 74 + 0.538462 / 16 = 0.04176198310810811
and 10 ** -1.344936 = 0.04519225372342939, this seems ok
bow(a_) = (1 - Sum_Z1 f(a_z)) / (1 - Sum_Z1 f(_z))
in this case d3 KaiKai and d3 b3
bow(d3) = (1 - 10 ** -0.916454 - 10 ** -0.5942346) / (1 - 10 ** -1.165775 - 10 ** -1.309463)
        = 0.7072027405302289
10 ** -0.1504561 = 0.7072026835806394, this seems ok

for Alice in 1-gram:
g(_z) = max(0, n(*_z) - D) / n(*_*)
g(_z) = (3 - 2.2) / 74 + 0.538462 / 16 = 0.04446468581081081
and 10 ** -1.309463 = 0.04903847996632592, this seems ok

Warning:
SRILM implements Kneser-Ney discounting by actually modifying the counts of the lower order N-grams. Thus, when the -write option is used to write the counts with -kndiscount or -ukndiscount, only the highest order N-grams and N-grams that start with <s> will have their regular counts c(a_z), all others will have the modified counts n(*_z) instead. See Warning 2 in the next section.
SO, IN THE CNT FILE THEY HAVE REGULAR COUNTS, WHICH IS NICE
It's the highest order
